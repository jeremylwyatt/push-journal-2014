	abstract = {Visual tracking of an object can provide a powerful source of feedback information during complex robotic manipulation operations, especially those in which there may be uncertainty about which new object pose may result from a planned manipulative action. At the same time, robotic manipulation can provide a challenging environment for visual tracking, with occlusions of the object by other objects or by the robot itself, and sudden changes in object pose that may be accompanied by motion blur. Recursive filtering techniques use motion models for predictor-corrector tracking, but the simple models typically used often fail to adequately predict the complex motions of manipulated objects. We show how statistical machine learning techniques can be used to train sophisticated motion predictors, which incorporate additional information by being conditioned on the planned manipulative action being executed. We then show how these learned predictors can be used to propagate the particles of a particle filter from one predictor-corrector step to the next, enabling a visual tracking algorithm to maintain plausible hypotheses about the location of an object, even during severe occlusion and other difficult conditions. We demonstrate the approach in the context of robotic push manipulation, where a 5-axis robot arm equipped with a rigid finger applies a series of pushes to an object, while it is tracked by a vision algorithm using a single camera.},

	abstract = {We are investigating the problem of predicting how objects behave under manipulative actions. In particular, we wish to predict the workpiece motions which will result from simple pushing manipulations by a single robotic fingertip. Such interactions are themselves fundamental components of multi-fingered grasping and other complex interactions. Physics simulators can be used to do this, but they model many kinds of object interactions poorly, being dependent on detailed scene descriptions and parameters, which in practice are often difficult to tune. Additionally, we have previously investigated ways of learning to predict, by employing density estimation techniques to learn, from many example pushes, a probabilistic mapping between applied pushing motions and resulting workpiece motions. In contrast, this paper presents an alternative approach to prediction, which does not rely on learning but infers the likelihood of possible workpiece motions by using the simple physics principle of minimum energy. This approach is advantageous in situations where insufficient prior knowledge is available for training our learned predictors. In such situations, possible strategies include either training learned predictors on unrealistic simulation data, or making use of the simple physics approach which requires no training. We show that the second of these strategies performs significantly better, and approaches the performance of learned predictors are trained on observations of real object motions.},

	abstract = {The primary goal of this research is to develop theoretical tools for analysis, synthesis, and application of primitive manipulator operations. The primary method is to extend an apply traditional tools of classical mechanics. The results are of such a general nature that they address many different aspects of industrial robotics, including effector and sensor design, planning and programming tools, and design of auxiliary equipment. Some of the manipulator operations studied are: Grasping an object: The object will usually slide and rotate during the period between first contact and prehension; Placing an object: The object may slip slightly in the fingers upon contact with the table as the base aligns with the table; and Pushing: Often the final stage of mating two parts involves pushing one object into the other. In each of these operations the motion of the object is determined partly by the manipulator and partly by frictional forces. Hence the theoretical analysis focuses on the problem of partially constrained motion with friction.},
